# Gradle for Android and Java

A demo app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. It consists
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.
